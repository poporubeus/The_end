This is the repository containing my Master thesis's project on QML.

I've started from an existing project where two kinds of quantum circuits (a feature map and the corresponding ansatz) were tested on a Supervised Learning (SL) problem with a customized galaxy dataset used to perform a binary image classification. I've added multiple quantum circuits taken out from different papers, combined together to build several Quantum Neural Networks and I tested their abilities on the binary SL problem, but introducing the Mnist dataset (0-1 digits) in addition to the galaxy dataset.
Afterwards, I tried to build a QCNN ansatz inspired from Cong's article and I examinated it on the same problem. Eventually I made a simple and fair classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tested on the same datasets, used to make a comaprison between quantum devices and classical counterparts.

The main idea of this project is based on an existing paper of 2022 [Generalization in QML from few training data - Caro,Cincio,Cerezo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32550-3);
